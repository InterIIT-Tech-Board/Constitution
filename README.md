# Constitution

This repository holds the latex source code, versions and the latest edition of the Constitution of the InterIIT Tech Meet. The constitution was established in 2018 by IIT Bombay as a means to formalize the organization of the InterIIT Tech Meet. Since then, the constitution has been passed from one Board to another. This repository has been set to track various aspects of the constitution, to simplify handing over of the constitution's source code and organize its changes over time. It will also hold various documentations pertaining to its amendments.
