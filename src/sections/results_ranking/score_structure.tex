% Content for Score Structure

\paragraph{}
A scoreboard will be maintained on the website of the meet. This will be updated after the announcement of results of individual events. The number of Gold, Silver, and Bronze Awards shall be restricted to a maximum of TWO in a particular problem statement. (**The only exception to this would be when multiple IITs have performed equally and tied at the qualifying cut-off in the problem statement.)

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The scores of the teams shall be normalized according to the mean of the scores acquired by all the participants,
    \item Gold shall be awarded to the team with the maximum normalised score and a maximum of one other team, provided their score lies within 5\% of this normalized score. In case, two or more teams are tied with the same score within this 5\% range, neither team will be awarded Gold,
    \item The scores of the remaining teams shall be normalized again according to the mean of the scores acquired by the remaining participants, 
    \item Silver shall be awarded to the team with the maximum normalised score and a maximum of one other team, provided their score lies within 5\% of this new normalized score. In case, two or more teams are tied with the same score within this 5\% range, neither team will be awarded Silver,
    \item The scores of the remaining teams shall be normalized again according to the mean of the scores acquired by the remaining participants, 
    \item Bronze shall be awarded to the team with the maximum normalised score and a maximum of one other team, provided their score lies within 5\% of this new normalized score. In case, two or more teams are tied with the same score within this 5\% range, neither team will be awarded Bronze,
    \item Instead of carrying forward the corresponding pre-decided points for Gold, Silver, and Bronze, the scores are then re-normalized about the mean of all the scores that are lower than the mean of the scores (threshold) acquired by all the participants,
    \item Each position after Gold, further receive a penalty of 10\%, cumulative with every position (with Silver and Bronze as equivalent positions, with no differentiation between the medal winners),
    \item Qualifying the threshold ensures that teams with a positive normalised score receive at least 10\% of event points. The other teams do not receive any points for participation, 
    \item The event points for each type of event as per event categorisation is left to the discretion of Host IIT and will be included in the Rulebook,
    \item No two events in the same category shall have different event points,
    \item Individual awards (bonuses of any kind), if any, shall not contribute towards the overall tally.
