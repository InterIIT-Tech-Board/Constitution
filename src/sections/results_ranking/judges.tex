\paragraph{}
The selection of Judges for all events will be at the discretion of the Host IIT. No bonafide student of any IIT shall be part of the judging panel. Decisions taken by the judges shall be final and binding in all cases. Care must be taken that judges are fully aware of the intricacies of the event and the judging criteria.
