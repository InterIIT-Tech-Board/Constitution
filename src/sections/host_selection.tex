% Content for Host Selection
\paragraph{}
The Host for the next InterIIT Tech Meet shall be decided at the ad-hoc Tech Board Meeting conducted before the end of the academic year. Each IIT willing to host the next InterIIT shall submit a proposal approved by the Director of their institute and shall submit the same to the Chairman of the Tech Board. In the event there is only a single IIT submitting a proposal, it shall be declared as Host IIT for the next InterIIT Meet. In an event where there are more than one IITs submitting proposals, there shall be a discussion of the proposals by the Tech Board. The Host will then be decided by preferential voting. The host IIT cannot submit a proposal for hosting the next edition during the second Tech Board Meeting. In the event that no IIT submits a proposal, the Chairman of the Tech Board shall invite proposals from Directors of IITs. At this stage, the Host IIT is also eligible to apply.
